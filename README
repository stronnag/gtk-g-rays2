Overview
~~~~~~~~

This is gtk-g-ray2, a tool to access the Wintec WBT-201 from free
operating systems (but you can use it on proprietary ones too if you
like).

gtk-rays-2
~~~~~~~~~~

There is a "C" version (current) and an older Ruby version, which is
useful for experimentation.

To build the 'C' version:

$ ./configure [--prefix=/usr]
$ make
$ sudo make install

By default, device names of /dev/ttyUSB0 and bluetooth are
offered. You can change the devices available by editing the file
$HOME/.config/g-rays2/g-rays2rc

(gtk-rays-2 creates the file on first run if it does not exist).

e.g.

$ cat /home/jrh/.config/g-rays2/g-rays2rc
[g-rays2]
devices = /dev/ttyUSB0;/dev/rfcomm0

After the key "devices = " there is a semi-colon (;) separated list of
possible device names.

e.g.
devices = /dev/ttyUSB0;/dev/ttyUSB1;/dev/ttyUSB2;/dev/rfcomm0;/dev/rfcomm1

Any device name of just "bluetooth" or containing the string "rfcomm"
will be cause bluetooth discovery to find the real device (new in 2.00).

From version 0.99, the preferences dialogue allows the user to set and
modify the serial device list.

In order to save log files using gpsbabel, it is necessary (as of
2007-05-19) to:

* Use the CVS version;

If the [CVS] version is earlier than 2007-07-03, then you need to:

* Apply a patch to get it to use standard input as the serial device.

The patch file is included in this archive as docs/gpsbabel-fd0_as_serial.patch

To apply:

$ cd gpsbabel # Source directory
$ # gtk-g-rays2 unpacked in /tmp/
$ patch < /tmp/gtk-g-rays2-0.4/wbt-201/docs/gpsbabel-fd0_as_serial.patch
$ make
$ # Now install on path

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

gtk+ 2.8.0 or later
libglade
cairo

If cairo is not available, then the application will build, without
the graphical component.

MacOSX
~~~~~~

From Matthias Wiedemann:

 updating gtk, because my fink gtk2 version was 2.6.10
	macport could give me version 2.10.11
	I think you need at least gtk 2.8

 - also, I fetched cairo libraries

 - yeah, it works on Mac OS

ruby 
~~~~

The ruby version is no longer included in the distributed
tar file. Just ask if you want it.

Historically:

For the ruby version (in the ruby directory).

Usage: wbt201.rb [options]
    -d, --dump-gps                   false
    -v, --verbose                    false
    -h, --help                       Show this message

Please be advised that wbt201.glade must be in the working directory
for the ruby version. This is feature.

See www/index.html or http://www.daria.co.uk/gps/ for more
details.
