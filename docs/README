Overview
~~~~~~~~

This is gtk-g-ray2, a tool to access the Wintec WBT-201 from free
operating systems (but you can use it on proprietary ones too if you
like).

gtk-rays-2
~~~~~~~~~~

There is a "C" version (current) and an older Ruby version, which is
useful for experimentation.

To build the 'C' version:

$ ./configure [--prefix=/usr]
$ make
$ sudo make install

By default, device names of /dev/ttyUSB0 and /dev/rfcomm0 are
offered. You can change the devices available by editing the file
$HOME/.config/g-rays2/g-rays2rc

(gtk-rays-2 creates the file on first run if it does not exist).

e.g.

$ cat /home/jrh/.config/g-rays2/g-rays2rc
[g-rays2]
devices = /dev/ttyUSB0;/dev/rfcomm0

After the key "devices = " there is a semi-colon (;) separated list of
possible device names.

e.g.
devices = /dev/ttyUSB0;/dev/ttyUSB1;/dev/ttyUSB2;/dev/rfcomm0;/dev/rfcomm1

The 'C' version is almost fully functional, however in order to save log
files using gpsbabel, it is necessary (as of 2007-05-19) to:

* Use the CVS version;

If the CVS version is earlier than 2007-07-03, then you need to:

* Apply a patch to get it to use standard input as the serial device.

The patch file is included in this archive as docs/gpsbabel-fd0_as_serial.patch

To apply:

$ cd gpsbabel # Source directory
$ # gtk-g-rays2 unpacked in /tmp/
$ patch < /tmp/gtk-g-rays2-0.4/wbt-201/docs/gpsbabel-fd0_as_serial.patch
$ make
$ # Now install on path

Usage: wbt201.rb [options]
    -d, --dump-gps                   false
    -v, --verbose                    false
    -h, --help                       Show this message
