	Gtk+-3.0 clean up. New bluetooth solution ...

2.02 2013-02-03
	Reworked bluetooth code to improve performance and stability.
	Reinstated manual BT workarounds (for Robert Peter). Updated the
	manual and added some notes on debugging BT issues.

2.01 2011-12-04
	Updated the Bluetooth code (C rather than vala generated).

2.0  2011-11-27
	GTK+-3.0 version. Added auto mode for device detection.

1.23 2011-03-05
	"March Madness". Runs when built without deprecated set
	(-DGDK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED=1 -DG_DISABLE_DEPRECATED)

1.22 2011-01-18
	"Cold Snap". Builds without deprecated set
	(-DGDK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED=1 -DG_DISABLE_DEPRECATED)

1.21 2010-07-02
	"Home coming". Added use of /dev/gpsN option. Not perfect but good
	enough for my purposes.

	Added a Gentoo patch (Samuli Suominen) to allow compilation with
	CFLAGS="-O0"

1.20 2009-06-25
	"Summer daze". Added a default save directory option.

1.11 2008-06-18
	"To the point". Incorporated a patch by Torsten Hilbrich to set
	LC_NUMERIC to 'C' while parsing GPS data. This gives correct
	values for decimal fields in locales where the decimal separator
	is not '.'. Output remains locale specific.

1.10 2008-04-12
       "First Cuckoo of spring". Fixed bug in glade file. No code changes.

1.06 2007-11-12
       "Self starter". Added the ability to call a script to set up and
	tear down the serial bindings, primarily for Bluetooth. Please see
	the manual for a description of how this works. A sample script
	for /dev/rfcommX (g-rays2-rfcomm.sh) is provided.

1.05 2007-11-11
	"Babel". Added gettext framework Changed mktime() to timegm() for
	NMEA data (reported by Tilman Vogel)

	Added the Nokia N800 (maemo) as a build target, fully integrated
	into the source tree. This was made possible by the efforts of
	Tilman Vogel, who did the Maemo port for 1.04. The Maemo port
	requires Tilman's port of gpsbabel.

	Debian builds are available for x86_64 (amd64), ia32 (i386),
	powerpc and maemo (N800) platforms.

1.04 2007-09-11
	"Build freely". Builds in FreeBSD.

1.03 2007-09-10
	"Deer Park". Set the saved file name to default to the date.

1.02 2007-07-28
	"Après nous le déluge". (sort of missed changes for  1.0,1.01).
	Documentation.
	Control-C in the Data window copies position, altitude, timestamp
	and H/V/PDOP to clipboard.
	Builds on MacOSX, thanks to some assistance from Matthias
	Wiedemann.

0.99 2007-07-07
	"Twice Daily". Added a preferences dialogue that allows you to
	save the device list names, and indicate if you want to save the
	last used device for subsequent recall.
	Added options for saving GPX; tracks, waypoints or both.
	Removed the 'popt' dependency.

0.5 2007-07-07
	"Seven times seven". Updated the README after Axel Müller pointed
	out that I hadn't documented how to change the device list
	entries. Please also note that CVS gpsbabel has the patch to allow
	stdin as the serial device, so you no longer need to patch it.  **
	No code changes. **

0.4 2007-06-01
	"Back from Tokyo". Device are now read from a configuration file,
	~/.config/g-rays2/g-rays2rc (which is created if it doesn't
	exist).  Mainly implemented on VS901 Narita to London.

0.1 2007-05-19
	"Fit for public consumption". I hope so. First real release.
